# meteorite_data

Hello, 
This repository is seeking to take a dataset from NASA and finding the continent with the most massive
meteorite strikes. I have done an Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA test) and a Contrast test to figure out 
the question at hand.

Included in this repository:
1) Meteorite-Landings.csv: the csv file that contains the data about the meteorites.
2) final_report.docx: this is the written report of the statistical analysis that was preformed.
3) final_project.RMD: this is the rmd file with the code that was used to create the final report.
